				Out of every game I could’ve made my first to finish this year I think 
				this was the best choice, I started Chrono Trigger in the winter around 
				the time I was finishing Drakengard which inspired me to pick up Chrono 
				Trigger again because Drakengard’s multiple endings reminded me of the 
				multiple endings Chrono Trigger is famous for. Yoko Taro will be here a 
				bit later, but this comparison was on my mind for a bit especially when 
				I read that Yoko Taro talked about wanting to differentiate Drakengard 
				from Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.

				I also replayed this game (with a fresh new save file) because I was seeing a 
				few of my friends playing through Chrono Cross and even had that game and Radical 
				Dreamers on my radar way back when I was just that kid that listened to way too many 
				video game soundtracks. I still need to play Chrono Cross and it’s something I’m certainly 
				going to be playing next year. I heard Chrono Cross is pretty similar to some of Yoko Taro’s 
				games when it comes to the writing so maybe this won’t be the last time I bring up his name with 
				the Chrono series in a tangential way.

				The last time I finished Chrono Trigger was back in the summer where I was going into high school 
				for the first time, I finished Earthbound on the Wii U before that and I was realizing that JRPGs 
				were something that I cared about enough to invest some time into finishing a game instead of just 
				playing them for a bit and then moving on (although this habit still hasn’t gone away entirely, yet). 
				Since that time, I finished games such as Final Fantasy VI and Dragon Quest VI which are two games 
				that were directly impacted by Chrono Trigger and even then I saw ripples of influence Chrono Trigger 
				had on games I played outside of those two games that just so happened to release around the time Chrono 
				Trigger was being developed/released.

				We can’t even really talk about this game without examining what Square and Enix were at this time, 
				they were making JRPGs that were in some ways very similar but structurally by the time they were coming 
				together to make Chrono Trigger, they were further apart than ever in their own ways. 
			</p>

				Yuji Horii got his start by making an adventure game series focused on utilizing an incredibly simplistic 
				menu system that would be used in Dragon Quest, and that sort of philosophy is something I feel differs 
				Dragon Quest from Final Fantasy as a whole, the focus on roleplay with these menu systems and interfaces 
				instead of putting all the chips on the immediate cinematic elements. Well I typed all this out, and then 
				remembered/researched that Horii said he wanted to make a game like Ultima and Wizardry but for a wider 
				audience so there you go, Dragon Quest was born from a desire to make the hardcore adventure something 
				that could be filed down to a size that kids and casual game fans could enjoy instead of people that, 
				actually liked math I don’t know.
